## **Executive Summary**

### **1. Temporal Review Distribution & Behavioral Pattern**
From 2019 to 2021, The ISP saw minimal review activity  a sign of low customer engagement or limited market presence. Starting 2022, reviews surged, peaking in 2024 and 2025. Notably, March and July 2025 recorded sudden spikes in highly positive reviews, sharply deviating from the steady flow of organic negative feedback.

### **2. Linguistic & Emotional Layer in Customer Reviews**

The ISP’s review landscape is heavily complaint driven, customers speak out when angry or not satisfied. Negative reviews dominate, often switching into Swahili or Sheng at peak frustration, signaling raw, local emotion. This linguistic shift highlights authenticity and urgency.

### **3. Indicators of Sentiment Engineering**

Positive reviews in March and July 2025 show suspicious clustering, a sharp contrast to the ongoing negative sentiment trend. These reviews often repeat polished, generic phrases like “seamless connectivity” and “unparalleled service,” lacking personal detail or emotional depth. Some even stop mid-sentence, hinting at copy-pasting. The timing and uniformity suggest possible PR-driven review injections to mask deeper service issues, rather than reflecting real customer satisfaction.This shows Evidence of Review farming

### **4. Sentiment Authenticity Index**

A custom Sentiment Authenticity Index was built to detect review manipulation using linguistic and emotional cues. Negative reviews ranked highest  full of raw emotion, dialect switches, and diverse complaints, showing real user experience. In contrast, positive reviews often lacked depth, relied on buzzwords, and appeared scripted. Neutral reviews were minimal and vague. The index highlights a clear skew: genuine emotion fuels complaints, while praise feels curated  suggesting reputation inflation rather than organic approval.

### **5.Weaknesses of  ISP**

The ISP shows clear strategic cracks. First, there's a trust deficit , scripted praise can't hide the volume of raw, frustrated complaints. Second, their messaging is culturally out of sync: real users vent in Swahili or plain English, while glowing reviews sound corporate and distant. Third, the ISP is reactive, only pushing positive sentiment after public backlash, not through consistent improvement. Finally, their digital strategy leans too heavily on appearances over real fixes. For a rival ISP, this opens the door to win by doing the opposite: lead with honesty, local connection, and steady, reliable service.
